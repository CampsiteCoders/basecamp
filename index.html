    <h1>Welcome to BaseCamp - Where You Learn The Basics</h1>
    
    <h2>Learn Git & GitHub & gitBash</h2>
    

    <h3>Things To Do</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Get up your free account at GitHub! <br />
        (If you are viewing this project, you obviously already have a GitHub account.)</li>
        <li>Go download Git onto your computer</li>
        <li>Open GitBash <br />
        On your computer's search bar type "gitBash" and your gitBash terminal will open up</li>
        <li>Learn a few basic command line codes</li>
        
        <li>Clone Someone Else's Code on GitHub:<br />
            Go to GitHub and get the ID for the "repo" that you want to clone.<br />
            Go to your terminal (command prompt) and type git commands  </li>          
         <li>Edit Cloned Project to make it your own unique website<br />
             Open the project in Visual Studio Code (or other IDE of your choice).</li>
         <li>Use GitBash to PUSH your edited cloned project up to GitHub- as a PULL REQUEST</li>
         
         <li>Create Your Own Code Repository on GitHub:<br />
             Go to GitHub and create a new repo. You can give it any name you want to. You will be given and address to your
            new gitHub repo. Now go to your gitBash terminal and navigate to the folder you created on your computer to hold
            your project files. First runs the 'dir' command to make sure you see your index.html file. Next type your
            'git init' command which will add a hidden folder to your project. This folder will be names .git and will contain files
            that you don't need to even look at. Next type in your 'git status' command and you should see your index.html files
            in red. You need to add files by typing the command 'git add .' 
            Now it is time to copy the files from your computer to GitHub. To do that
            you need to type in the 'git commit -m "some comment about what you did to the code"'. 
            The first time you do this,
            you will need to define where on GitHub your code is supposed to reside. This is where you type in the URL path
            that was given to you when you first created the project. You will type in the command 'git remote add origin https://github.com/yourname/yourRepoName.git.
            Now you can push your code up to GitHub by typing the command 'git push -u origin master' <br />
        <code>
           $ dir <br />
           $ git init <br />
           $ git status<br />
           $ git add .<br />
           $ git commit -m "first commit"<br />
           $ git remote add origin https://github.com/CampstiteCoders/basecamp.git<br />
           $ git push -u origin master<br />

        </code>
        </li>        
        </li>  
        <li>Use GitBash to PUSH your edited original code project back up to GitHub</li>
       <li>TO BE CONTINUED:</li>
